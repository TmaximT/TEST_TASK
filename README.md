# TEST_TASK

This program allows you to encode and decode convolutional codes using the Viterbi algorithm,
as well as test a binary symmetric communication channel model with a given error probability (The testing information will be in the file TestBSC.txt)

Below is a diagram of the dependence of the error probability per decoder output bit on the error probability in the channel with a message length of 100 bits and a message count of 10000
